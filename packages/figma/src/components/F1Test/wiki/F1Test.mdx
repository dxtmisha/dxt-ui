The `F1Test` component is a minimalist UI element designed for displaying a single string of text. It serves as a foundational building block, enabling simple, static text rendering within a user interface.

Its primary role is to render the provided `value` prop directly. This facilitates straightforward integration for presenting short, static content such as labels, messages, or placeholders. The `value` prop is optional; if provided, its content is displayed. If omitted, the component renders an empty string, effectively displaying nothing.

**Key Features:**

- Displays a single string value.
- Simple integration with minimal properties.
- Supports an optional `value` prop.

**Typical Use Cases:**

- Displaying short messages or labels.
- Serving as a placeholder for content under development.
- Basic text output in debugging or testing scenarios.

## Usage Examples
### Basic Display

<Canvas of={Component.Basic}/>

### No Value

<Canvas of={Component.NoValue}/>
