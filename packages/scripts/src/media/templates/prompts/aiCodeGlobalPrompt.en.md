### Global Development Principles (AI Code Promise)

Strictly follow these rules for flawless dxt-ui code:

0. **Mandatory Deep Study (CHRONOLOGICAL GUARD)**:
   - **Step 1**: Read/create local `ai-memory.md` strictly in the current package root (e.g., `packages/constructor/`). Using repository root `ai-memory.md` for package files is FORBIDDEN.
   - **Step 2**: Read root `ai-prompt.md` and study descriptions of all mentioned libraries.
   - **Step 3**: Read all linked `ai-types.md` and `ai-developer.md` BEFORE proposing plans, calling `list_dir`, or writing code. If a package is in `node_modules/` but exists locally (e.g., `packages/`), resolve and study the local source instead.
   - Fully read files via `view_file` before modifying. Superficial scans (grep only) are strictly forbidden. Always check existing infrastructure before writing custom logic.

1. **"Copy-Paste Ready"**: Generate complete, runnable files with correct imports. No placeholders (e.g., `// rest of code`).
2. **Zero Hallucinations**: Strictly use `package.json` dependencies. No invented APIs. Ask if unsure.
3. **Clean Code (DRY/KISS/SOLID)**: Declarative style. Single responsibility (1 task = 1 function). No abbreviations (`el`, `val`, etc. are forbidden). Optimized and legible.
4. **Uncompromising TS**: No `any` (use `unknown` or generics). Interfaces for all I/O. `as const`, `readonly`, enums. Use `@ts-expect-error` with comments, never `@ts-ignore`.
5. **Professional Documentation (TSDoc)**: Document all exported entities (purpose, params, returns) in [wikiLanguage]. Include examples for complex logic.
6. **Architectural Consistency**: Respect project structure. Reuse existing infrastructure (always check `ai-types.md` first). Do not modify global/base UI styles unless explicitly requested.
7. **Security & Performance**: Error-proof code (`?.`, `??`, guard clauses). Use explicit `try-catch` for async. Never swallow errors. Avoid heavy ops in loops/reactivity.
8. **Aesthetics & Conciseness**: Group logically. Save tokens by avoiding redundant comments if code is self-explanatory.
9. **Strict Adherence & Optimization**: Follow instructions precisely without guessing. Propose relevant technical optimizations while strictly adhering to plans.
10. **AI Workspace Memory (`ai-memory.md`)**: Actively APPLY its rules (highest priority). Update it on developer feedback. Do NOT store change logs or absolute paths (use relative). Keep it focused strictly on architectural constraints.
11. **Mandatory Full-File Self-Audit**: When creating new entities, you MUST audit the ENTIRE file (not just modified parts) to ensure no logic duplication (DRY) and full compliance with project rules. *Exception: minor bug fixes to existing code do not require a full audit.*
