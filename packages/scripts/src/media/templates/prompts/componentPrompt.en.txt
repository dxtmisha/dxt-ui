You are a professional technical writer and developer. Your task is to create comprehensive documentation for a Vue 3 component in [wikiLanguage] in MDX format for Storybook.

Use the following template and style.

### Input Data:
- Component code, types, and current stories (will be provided at the end of the request).
- Fully analyze the component code, including props, emits, slots, and expose.
- Section title: [title] (insert it into <Meta title='...'/>).
- [title] insert as is, this is a label for the script.
- Documentation must be in [wikiLanguage].
- All headings and descriptions must be in [wikiLanguage] (all content described in the "Documentation Structure" section must be in [wikiLanguage], e.g., "Parameters", "Returns").

### Documentation Structure:

1.  **Description**:
    - Paragraph with description: purpose of the component, main use cases, benefits.

2.  **Key Features**:
    - Heading `## Key Features`
    - Bulleted list.
    - Format: `- **Feature Name** — description.`

3.  **Typical Use Cases**:
    - Heading `## Typical Use Cases`
    - Bulleted list.
    - Format: `- Use case.`

4.  **Basic Usage**:
    - Code example using the component.
        ```html
        <script setup>
        // Script code
        </script>

        <template>
          <Component />
        </template>
        ```

5.  **Logical Property Groups (Props)**:
    - Do not create a single general list of all properties. Analyze props and divide them into logical groups (topics), as in the examples "Navigation", "Asynchronous Loading", "State Management".
    - For each group create a separate section:
        - Heading `## Functionality Name` (e.g., "AJAX Loading" or "Navigation").
        - Text description: Explain how the properties of this group work together and what problem they solve.
        - List of group properties: `- propName — description`.
        - Code example: Show the use of specifically these properties together.
    - Skip obvious properties (standard attributes) if they do not affect specific logic.

6.  **Data Types** (Optional, if there are additional important types not described in the Function section):
    - Heading `## Data Types`

7.  **Events**:
    - Heading `## Events`
    - For each event:
        - `### eventName`
        - Description of when it triggers.
        - **Parameters:**
            - List: `- `name: type` — description`.
        - Code example (if the event is complex).

8.  **Expose (Component Methods)**:
    - Heading `## Expose`
    - For each public method (accessible via ref):
        - `### methodName()`
        - Description of the action.
        - **Returns:** `Type` (or `void`).

9.  **Slots**:
    - Heading `## Slots`
    - For each slot:
        - `### slotName`
        - Description of purpose.
        - **Parameters (Scoped Props):**
            - List: `- `name: type` — description`.
        - Code example using the slot.

### Instructions:
1. Study the provided component code (including props, emits, slots, expose).
2. Identify all public interfaces.
3. Generate documentation strictly following the template above.
3.1. If a component, prop, event, or slot is already described and there were no changes, do not correct the description.
3.2. Try to keep original descriptions unchanged.
4. Use the correct terminology (Props, Events, Slots, Expose).
4.1. All headings must be in [wikiLanguage].
5. Do not add unnecessary introductions or conclusions, only MDX.
6. Return only the full MDX code of the documentation without any additional text, comments, or markdown formatting (```).
7. The result must be exclusively text (response), do not attach any files.
8. Response format. Your response must consist strictly of 5 parts, separated by the separator "#########". Do not add any text before or after this format.

**Technical Requirements (strictly preserve the following lines without changes):**
- `const meta = ...` — Storybook configuration.
- `import * as Component from ...` — component import.
- `import { Meta } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks'` — system import.
- `import { StorybookMain } from '@dxtmisha/wiki/storybook'` — system import.

Format:
[short description in a few words (3-5) about the component's purpose]
#########
[original component code (*.vue) with comments for methods (add them if missing). If all comments are already present, return --FULL--]
#########
[original component typing code (types.ts) with comments for props, emits, slots, and expose (add them if missing). If all comments are already present, return --FULL--]
#########
[original stories code (*.stories.ts). Analyze and add missing scenarios (stories) if necessary. If current stories are sufficient, return --FULL--]
#########
[the documentation itself in MDX format following the template above].
