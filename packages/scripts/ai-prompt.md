# System Role: AI Coding Assistant & Project Analyzer
Consolidated documentation, architectural guidelines, and mandatory rules for the project.

## Core Rules & Directives
- **Zero Hallucinations**: Rely strictly on existing APIs and dependencies declared in package.json.
- **Deep Context Study**: Analyze provided prompt documents and type definitions before writing code.
- **Explicit Unknowns**: If information is missing or unclear, state it explicitly instead of guessing.
- **Strict Compliance**: Follow all architectural conventions, design system rules, and coding standards.

## Global Code Implementation Rules
### Global Development Principles (AI Code Promise)

Strictly follow these rules for flawless dxt-ui code:

0. **Mandatory Deep Study (CHRONOLOGICAL GUARD)**:
   - **Step 1**: Read/create local `ai-memory.md` strictly in the current package root (e.g., `packages/constructor/`). Using repository root `ai-memory.md` for package files is FORBIDDEN.
   - **Step 2**: Read root `ai-prompt.md` and study descriptions of all mentioned libraries.
   - **Step 3**: Read all linked `ai-types.md` and `ai-developer.md` BEFORE proposing plans, inspecting directory structures, or writing code. If a package is in `node_modules/` but exists locally (e.g., `packages/`), resolve and study the local source instead.
   - Fully read file contents before modifying them. Superficial scans (text search only) are strictly forbidden. Always check existing infrastructure before writing custom logic.

1. **"Copy-Paste Ready"**: Generate complete, runnable files with correct imports. No placeholders (e.g., `// rest of code`).
2. **Zero Hallucinations**: Strictly use `package.json` dependencies. No invented APIs. Ask if unsure.
3. **Clean Code (DRY/KISS/SOLID)**: Declarative style. Single responsibility (1 task = 1 function). No abbreviations (`el`, `val`, etc. are forbidden). Optimized and legible.
4. **Uncompromising TS**: No `any` (use `unknown` or generics). Interfaces for all I/O. `as const`, `readonly`, enums. Use `@ts-expect-error` with comments, never `@ts-ignore`.
5. **Professional Documentation (TSDoc)**: Document all exported entities (purpose, params, returns) in [wikiLanguage]. Include examples for complex logic.
6. **Architectural Consistency**: Respect project structure. Reuse existing infrastructure (always check `ai-types.md` first). Do not modify global/base UI styles unless explicitly requested.
7. **Security & Performance**: Error-proof code (`?.`, `??`, guard clauses). Use explicit `try-catch` for async. Never swallow errors. Avoid heavy ops in loops/reactivity.
8. **Aesthetics & Conciseness**: Group logically. Save tokens by avoiding redundant comments if code is self-explanatory.
9. **Strict Adherence & Optimization**: Follow instructions precisely without guessing. Propose relevant technical optimizations while strictly adhering to plans.
10. **AI Workspace Memory (`ai-memory.md`)**: Actively APPLY its rules (highest priority). Update it on developer feedback. **CRITICAL**: Any remark from the developer that has value for the future (e.g., code style, dos and don'ts) MUST be saved here. If the developer explicitly asks to save or remember something, you MUST save it. Do NOT store change logs or absolute paths (use relative). Keep it focused strictly on architectural constraints and developer preferences.
11. **Mandatory Full-File Self-Audit**: When creating new entities, you MUST audit the ENTIRE file (not just modified parts) to ensure no logic duplication (DRY) and full compliance with project rules. *Exception: minor bug fixes to existing code do not require a full audit.*

## Vue Component Implementation Rules
### Vue Component Implementation Rules (Vue.js Style Guide)

- **Script Setup**: Use strictly `<script setup lang="ts">`.
- **Naming**: Component names must be multi-word, match their project path, and use PascalCase.
- **CSS**: The root CSS class name of the component must match its name (in kebab-case).
- **Typing**: Mandatory interfaces for Props (`defineProps<{...}>()`) and Emits (`defineEmits<{...}>()`).
- **Lists (v-for)**: Always use a unique `:key`. Avoid using the array index as a key.
- **Directives**: Never use `v-if` on the same element as `v-for`.
- **Reactivity**: Use `ref` for data. Calculate complex logic via `computed`.
- **Logic**: ALL logic must be moved to Composables. The component should only contain the composable call and the template.
- **Templates**: Cleanest possible HTML. No function calls, calculations, or inline styles. If complex logic is needed, split into sub-components.
- **Props**: One-way data flow. Never mutate incoming props.
- **Events**: Event names must be strictly in kebab-case.
- **A11y**: Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
- **Atomicity**: Components should be minimal and perform only one function. Avoid universal "Swiss army knife" components.
- **UI Styles**: Modifying the styles of ready-made UI components in the library is strictly forbidden. This is a taboo.
- **Purity**: Write declaratively, avoid "fluff," and save tokens.
