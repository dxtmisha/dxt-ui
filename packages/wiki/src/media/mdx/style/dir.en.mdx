## Managing Component Direction

The `dir` property controls the mirroring of the component based on the site's text direction (LTR/RTL).
It ensures the correct interface display for right-to-left languages.

### Properties

- **dir** â€” Boolean property. When `true`, the component will be mirrored when the page direction is `rtl`.

### Description

- When `dir=false`, the component is rendered normally.
- When `dir=true`, the component is horizontally mirrored.
- This property only affects the visual presentation, not the component's content.

### Recommendations

- Use alongside your app's localization settings.
- Particularly useful for arrow icons that also need to flip when direction changes.
- Verify third-party SVG icons as they might have preset directions.
