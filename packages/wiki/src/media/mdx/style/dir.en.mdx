## Managing Component Direction

The `dir` property controls the mirroring of the component based on the site's text direction (LTR/RTL).
It ensures the correct interface display for right-to-left languages.

### Recommendations

- Use alongside your app's localization settings.
- Particularly useful for arrow icons that also need to flip when a direction changes.
- Verify third-party SVG icons as they might have preset directions.
