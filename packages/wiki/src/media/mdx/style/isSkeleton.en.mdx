## Skeleton Mode

The `isSkeleton` property works in conjunction with the `Skeleton` component. When an element is a child of the `Skeleton` component and has the `isSkeleton` property, its display depends on the parent `Skeleton`'s state.

### Properties

- **isSkeleton** — Boolean property. Determines whether the element participates in skeleton mode.

### Description

- When `active=false` on the `Skeleton` component, all child elements display normally, regardless of the `isSkeleton` value.
- When `active=true` on the `Skeleton` component, all child elements enter skeleton mode, but behavior depends on `isSkeleton`:
  - If the element has `isSkeleton=true` — the element displays as a skeleton
  - If the element has `isSkeleton=false` — the element becomes invisible

### Recommendations

- Use only inside the `Skeleton` component.
- Suitable for creating interactive loading states with smooth transitions.
