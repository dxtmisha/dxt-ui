## Adaptive Behavior

The `adaptive` and `container` properties are designed to control component behavior at different screen sizes and container constraints.

**Properties:**

- `adaptive` — controls adaptive behavior for different screen sizes and media queries
- `container` — controls container layout with adaptive width constraints

Properties work together: `adaptive` provides automatic component adaptation to different screen sizes with media query support for precise display control. `container` creates a container layout with automatic width constraints, adaptive behavior, and content centering. Both properties can be used together to create complex adaptive layouts, where `container` provides the structural foundation and `adaptive` adds flexible behavior for different devices.
