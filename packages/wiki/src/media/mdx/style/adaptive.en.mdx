## Adaptive Layout and Container Constraints

The `adaptive` and `container` properties control component behavior at different screen sizes and container constraints. These properties allow creating flexible adaptive interfaces that display correctly on all devices.

### Properties

- **adaptive** — Controls adaptive display behavior for different screen sizes and media queries. Allows the component to automatically adjust to different display conditions.
- **container** — Controls container-based layout behavior with adaptive width constraints and containment context. Enables a special container mode with width limitations.

### Description

- The `adaptive` property provides automatic adaptation to various screen sizes with media query support for precise display control.
- `container` creates a container layout with automatic width constraints, adaptive behavior, and content centering.
- Properties can be used together to create complex adaptive layouts, where `container` provides the structural foundation and `adaptive` adds flexible behavior.

### Recommendations

- Use `adaptive` for components that should change their behavior depending on screen size.
- Apply `container` for creating main blocks with limited width and centering.
- Combine both properties to achieve maximum flexibility in adaptive layout.
