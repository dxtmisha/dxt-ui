Container for organizing action buttons with support for primary and secondary grouping, various alignment modes, and adaptive behavior.

Actions centralizes the management of interactive button placement in dialogs, forms, and panels, automatically distributes space between groups, supports flexible adaptation to available space, and provides a unified API for creating consistent action sets. It serves as a fundamental component for building user interfaces with clear button hierarchy.

**Core capabilities:**

- Button grouping (primary group via list, secondary via listSecondary)
- Alignment control (left, right, center, block, none)
- Adaptive behavior through flexible property (adaptive/container)
- Automatic spacer between button groups
- Separate attribute configuration (buttonAttrs, buttonSecondaryAttrs)
- Slot support for custom content (default, secondary)
- Integration with Button component with all its features
- Flexible layout with automatic transition to block mode

**Typical use cases:**

- Action panels in dialogs and modal windows
- Button sets in forms (cancel, save, apply)
- Control panels with primary and auxiliary actions
- Adaptive interfaces with automatic restructuring on mobile devices

```html
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { Actions } from '@dxtmisha/constructor'

const isLoading = ref(false)

const handleSave = async () => {
  isLoading.value = true
  await saveData()
  isLoading.value = false
}
</script>

<template>
  <Actions
    align="right"
    :list="[
      { label: 'Cancel' },
      { label: 'Save', primary: true, loading: isLoading }
    ]"
  />
</template>
```

> Actions is a smart container: it automatically manages button placement, adapts to screen size, and provides visual hierarchy between primary and secondary actions.
