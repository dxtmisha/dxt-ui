## Adaptive layout behavior

The `flexible` property determines automatic switching to block mode when space is limited.

**Possible values:**

- `'adaptive'` — uses media queries to determine breakpoint
- `'container'` — uses container queries to adapt to parent size

Automatically applies `align="block"` property when available space becomes smaller than a defined breakpoint. With `adaptive` it tracks screen width through media queries, with `container` it adapts to parent container size. Suitable for creating adaptive interfaces that display correctly on both desktop and mobile devices without additional code.

```html
<!-- Automatic transition on narrow screens -->
<Actions flexible="adaptive" :list="[...]" />

<!-- Adapts to parent size -->
<Actions flexible="container" :list="[...]" />
```
