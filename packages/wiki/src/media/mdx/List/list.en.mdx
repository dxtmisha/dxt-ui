The List component is a powerful interactive list with support for hierarchical data, keyboard navigation, and search functionality. It is designed to display structured data with navigation capabilities, item selection, and interaction through keyboard and mouse.

## Core Features

List supports various item types: regular items, groups, menus, separators, and subtitles. The component automatically handles complex hierarchical structures and provides intuitive navigation between elements.

## Keyboard Navigation

The component supports full keyboard navigation:
- **↑/↓** - navigate between items
- **Enter/→** - open groups/menus or select item
- **←** - close groups/menus
- **Type text** - search through items
- **Backspace** - clear search

## Search and Highlighting

Built-in search functionality allows finding items in real-time with automatic highlighting of matches. Search works across the entire data hierarchy, including nested groups and menus.

## Performance

For working with large datasets, the component provides a lightweight rendering mode that automatically activates when the specified threshold of item count is exceeded, ensuring high performance without losing functionality.
