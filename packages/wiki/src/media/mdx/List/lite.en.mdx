## Lightweight list mode

The `lite` and `liteThreshold` properties control the simplified (lightweight) rendering mode of the list.

### Properties

- **lite** — Enables the lightweight rendering mode
- **liteThreshold** — Item count threshold that is applied when `lite` is enabled

### Property relationship

The properties work together to decide when the simplified rendering should be applied:

- If `lite = false` (or not set), the list always renders in full mode and `liteThreshold` is ignored
- If `lite = true`, the component compares the total item count with `liteThreshold`
  - When `count <= liteThreshold`, full mode is used (no simplification)
  - When `count > liteThreshold`, lightweight mode turns on to reduce visual complexity and speed up rendering

This approach helps avoid unnecessary load with large datasets while keeping the familiar full rendering for short lists.
