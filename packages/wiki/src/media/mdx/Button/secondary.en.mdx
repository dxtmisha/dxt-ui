## Secondary Button Style

The `secondary` property activates the secondary visual style of the button, which is less intrusive than the primary style and is used for alternative or less important actions.

### Purpose

- **Alternative actions** — Provides the user with a choice of several actions
- **Reduced visual load** — Helps to avoid overloading the interface with accent elements
- **Grouping actions** — Used to group related but not primary actions

### Usage

The property is recommended for:
- Secondary actions in forms (cancel, reset)
- Additional options or settings
- Less priority actions on the page

### Features

- **Moderate contrast** — Uses colors with less contrast than the primary style
- **Consistency** — Harmoniously combines with the primary style and other elements
