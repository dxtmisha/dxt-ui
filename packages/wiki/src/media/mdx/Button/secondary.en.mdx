## Secondary buttons

Button component supports secondary mode through the `secondary` property. In this mode, buttons have a less prominent visual style for alternative or supporting actions:

- **Moderate emphasis** - less intrusive than primary buttons while remaining clear
- **Action alternatives** - provides users with alternative choices without overwhelming them
- **Balanced contrast** - uses colors with moderate contrast for better visual hierarchy
- **Icon support** - maintains consistency with other button variants through visual elements

Secondary mode is especially useful for creating cancel buttons, reset actions, and alternative choices that support the main flow without competing for primary attention in the interface.

```html
<Button secondary icon="close">Cancel</Button>
<Button secondary icon="refresh">Reset</Button>
<Button secondary>Skip</Button>
```
