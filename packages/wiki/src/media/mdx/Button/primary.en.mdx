## Primary buttons

Button component supports primary mode through the `primary` property. In this mode, buttons have a distinctive visual style for the most important actions:

- **Visual emphasis** - stands out prominently among other interface elements
- **Action hierarchy** - indicates the main or priority action on the page
- **High contrast** - automatically applies high-contrast colors for better visibility
- **Icon support** - enhances understanding of purpose through visual elements

Primary mode is especially useful for creating main call-to-action buttons, form submissions, and confirmation actions that require user attention and should be immediately recognizable in the interface.

<Button primary icon="send">Submit</Button>
<Button primary icon="save">Save</Button>
<Button primary>Confirm</Button>
```
