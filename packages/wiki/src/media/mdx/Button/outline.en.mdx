## Outline buttons

Button component supports outline mode through the `outline` property. In this mode, buttons have a minimalist visual style with transparent background and colored border:

- **Minimalist design** - suitable for interfaces requiring reduced visual load
- **Transparent background** - maintains clean appearance while remaining interactive
- **Hover feedback** - background appears on hover for better user interaction
- **Icon support** - works seamlessly with icons for enhanced clarity

Outline mode is especially useful for creating tertiary actions, filter controls, and secondary options in cards or lists that need to be accessible without excessive visual noise.

```html
<Button outline icon="filter">Filter</Button>
<Button outline icon="sort">Sort</Button>
<Button outline>More options</Button>
```
