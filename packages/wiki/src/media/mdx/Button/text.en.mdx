## Text buttons

Button component supports text mode through the `text` property. In this mode, buttons have a minimalist text-only style resembling links for the most unobtrusive actions:

- **Unobtrusive design** - looks like plain text while remaining interactive
- **No background or border** - maintains clean appearance without visual weight
- **Hover feedback** - subtle background appears on hover for better interaction clarity
- **Icon support** - seamlessly integrates icons while maintaining minimal visual impact

Text mode is especially useful for creating tertiary actions, inline navigation links, and supplementary options within text content or footers that need to be accessible without drawing excessive attention.

```html
<Button text icon="info">Learn more</Button>
<Button text icon="help">Help</Button>
<Button text>Read details</Button>
```
