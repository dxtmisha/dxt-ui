## Text Button Style

The `text` property applies a text style to the button, making it look like a link. This style is used for the least intrusive actions.

### Purpose
- **Tertiary actions** — For actions that should look like text but be interactive.
- **Unobtrusive design** — Ideal for actions within text or where the button should not be distracting.

### Usage
- "Learn more" links.
- Actions in a footer or menu.

### Features
- **No background or border** — The button looks like plain text.
- **Hover background** — A background appears on hover for better feedback.
