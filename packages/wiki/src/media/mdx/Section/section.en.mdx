## Description

A semantic container component designed for grouping related content. It uses the `<section>` tag by default.

Section provides capabilities for displaying headlines, labels, descriptions, captions, and icons. The main purpose of the component is to designate thematic sections of a document, which improves the semantics and accessibility of the page. The headline is rendered as `<h2>` by default.

**Key Features:**

- Semantic content grouping (`<section>` tag)
- Support for headlines (default `<h2>`), labels, descriptions, and captions
- Support for icons
- Customizable layout and spacing
- Full support for slots for content customization

**Typical Use Cases:**

- Thematic page sections
- Content grouping in articles
- Information blocks with second-level headings
- Landing page sections

```html
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
</script>

<template>
  <Section
    headline="Section Headline"
    label="Label"
    description="Description of this section's content"
  >
    <p>Main section content...</p>
  </Section>
</template>
```

> Section is the semantically correct choice for dividing a page into large logical blocks.
