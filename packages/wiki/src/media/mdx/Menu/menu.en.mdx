The Menu component is a popup menu for navigation and actions. It combines Window (container and positioning), Bars (action toolbar), and List (items, groups, and nested submenus), providing keyboard navigation, nested structure support, a lightweight rendering mode (lite with liteThreshold), and controlled open/close behavior.
