FieldLabel is a component for displaying a field label and a required indicator.

### Purpose

- **Field label** — A caption for the input control
- **Required marker** — Shows a required state when needed
- **Compatibility** — Works together with FieldCounter and Progress
- **Consistent style** — Unified classes and spacing within form controls

### Key features

- **Simple usage** — Just pass the `label` prop
- **Required marker** — Enable via the `required` prop
- **Character counter** — Renders when counter props (counter/maxlength) are provided
- **Progress indicator** — Can display progress (e.g., loading)

### Integration

Use FieldLabel as a part of composite input controls. When needed, add FieldCounter and Progress via corresponding props to make forms more informative.

> The component is responsible for rendering the label and does not affect input logic.
