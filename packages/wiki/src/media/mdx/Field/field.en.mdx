Field is the base container for form controls that composes label, messages, counter, icons, and progress. It provides a unified skeleton and classes for consistent layout.

### Purpose

- **Composition of subcomponents** — FieldLabel, FieldMessage, FieldCounter, Progress, icons
- **Unified scaffold** — Wrapper template for the input area and helper zones (caption/prefix/suffix)
- **State styles** — Manages focus, disabled, readonly, selected, block
- **Slot support** — Integrates caption, prefix, suffix at the container level

### Core capabilities

- **Validation highlighting** — Based on `validationMessage` and a force show flag
- **Character counter** — Position toggle via `counterTop`
- **Control icons** — Cancel and navigation (arrows) with visibility flags
- **Sizing helpers** — Built-in FieldSize and FieldIcons
- **Progress integration** — Compact static progress for loading/status

### Integration

Use Field as a foundation for constructing any input fields. It easily integrates labels, icons, messages, and progress. The component handles markup, classes, and consistency; concrete inputs provide the input logic.

> Field is a constructor wrapper: it doesn’t input data by itself, it organizes structure and auxiliary visuals.
