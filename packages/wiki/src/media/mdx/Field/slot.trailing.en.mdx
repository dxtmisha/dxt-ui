### `trailing`

Slot for placing custom content at the end of the interactive field area (after the main input content flow but before internal control icons).

- Positioned at the logical end (right in LTR, left in RTL)
- Good for action icons (clear, open, toggle), counters, lightweight status badges
- Receives the same control props object (`{ id, className, classHidden }`) as the default slot
- Keep it concise; avoid large buttons that disrupt layout
- Does not replace `suffix` â€” use `suffix` for semantic ending text, `trailing` for functional / dynamic UI
