## Scroll Management during Animation

The component automatically manages scroll visibility during transition animations to prevent content jumps.

### Usage

To enable this feature, add the `*__scroll` class to the parent container that has scrolling.

1.  Wrap the component in a scrollable container.
2.  Add the `*__scroll` class to this container (where `*` is the component class name, e.g., `d1-tabs__scroll`).

```html
<div class="d1-tabs__scroll">
  <Tabs ... />
</div>
```

During the animation, the component will automatically add the `*__scroll--hidden` class (which applies `overflow: hidden`) to this container, and remove it after the animation ends.
