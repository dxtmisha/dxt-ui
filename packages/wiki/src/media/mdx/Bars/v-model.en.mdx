## Two-way binding (v-model)

The Bars component supports two-way binding for the `action` state using the `v-model:action` directive.

### Usage

This allows you to synchronize the action mode of the bar with a local data property in your parent component.

```html
<Bars v-model:action="isAction"/>
```

### How it works

The `v-model:action` is a shorthand for binding the `action` prop and listening to the `update:action` event.

- **`:action=\"isAction\"`** — The action mode is controlled by the `isAction` ref.
- **`@update:action=\"isAction = $event\"`** — When the internal state changes, the component emits an event to update the parent’s `isAction` ref.
