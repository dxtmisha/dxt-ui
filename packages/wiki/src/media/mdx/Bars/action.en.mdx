## Action mode

Properties that switch Bars into a contextual action bar when selecting items or entering bulk-edit mode: `action` activates the mode, `actionLabel` and `actionDescription` replace the main content, `actionBars` provides a specialized button set for operations.

```
action?: boolean
actionLabel?: string | number
actionDescription?: string
actionBars?: Button[]
```

### Properties

- **`action`** — Switches the bar into action context with full content replacement
- **`actionLabel`** — Primary action mode title (typically a count of selected items)
- **`actionDescription`** — Additional description or instruction for the current action
- **`actionBars`** — Array of action buttons for operations on selected elements

### When to use

- **Item selection** — User has selected one or more items in a list or table
- **Bulk operations** — Actions are needed on a group of selected objects
- **Contextual menus** — Replace the standard bar with specialized actions
- **Temporary modes** — Focus the interface on a specific task with exit capability

### Comparison

- **`label` vs `actionLabel`** — Regular title is replaced with selection count or description
- **`description` vs `actionDescription`** — Standard description becomes action instruction
- **`bars` vs `actionBars`** — Regular buttons are replaced with context-specific ones
- **Navigation** — Back button becomes an exit button for leaving action mode

### Features

- **Complete content replacement** — All text areas and buttons are replaced with action variants
- **Configuration preservation** — Shared button attributes (buttonAttrs) apply to actionBars
- **Unified styling** — Action mode inherits all styling and behavior from the main component
- **Programmatic control** — Mode is controlled by external selection state

> Use short, clear labels in actionLabel and limit actionBars to 3–4 key actions for better user experience.
