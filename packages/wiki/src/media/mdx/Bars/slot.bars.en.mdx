### `bars`

Slot for rendering the set of action buttons in the regular (non‑action) mode. It lets you fully customize the composition, order, and appearance of buttons aligned to the right of the label.

This slot lets you:
- Place any buttons/controls instead of the default set
- Control ordering, grouping, and separators for actions
- Pass custom attributes to icons and buttons via scoped props
- Implement responsive behavior (collapse/hide actions on narrow screens)

The `bars` area is typically right‑aligned and inherits sizing/spacing from the base Bars styles.
