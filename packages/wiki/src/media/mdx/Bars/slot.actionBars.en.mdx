### `actionBars`

Slot for rendering the set of action buttons in action mode. It lets you fully redefine specialized actions that appear when selection mode is active.

This slot lets you:
- Define domainâ€‘specific actions for selected items (e.g., share, move, delete)
- Control ordering, grouping, and button state
- Pass custom attributes to icons and buttons via scoped props
- Implement responsive behavior and collapse secondary actions

The `actionBars` area is shown instead of the regular `bars` when action mode is enabled and inherits sizing/spacing from the base Bars styles.
