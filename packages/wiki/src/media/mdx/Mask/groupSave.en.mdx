## Cursor Behavior Control

The `groupSave` property controls cursor behavior when navigating between different special character groups in the mask. When set to `true` (default), it enables intelligent navigation that improves user experience when working with complex masks.

### Navigation Mechanism

During mask navigation, the system checks:
- Current cursor position
- Type of special character at current position
- Type of the next special character
- If characters belong to different groups, special movement logic is applied

### Usage Examples

```html
// Standard behavior (default)
<Mask
  :mask="'***-###-XXX'"
  :special="['*', '#', 'X']"
  :groupSave="true"
/>

// Disable smart navigation
<Mask
  :mask="'***-###-XXX'"
  :special="['*', '#', 'X']"
  :groupSave="false"
/>

// Complex mask with multiple groups
<Mask
  :mask="'AAA-111-BBB-222'"
  :special="['A', '1', 'B', '2']"
  :groupSave="true"
/>
```

### When to Use

#### groupSave: true (recommended)
- For masks with multiple group types
- When smooth navigation between groups is needed
- In most user interface scenarios

#### groupSave: false
- For simple masks with single symbol type
- When standard cursor behavior is required
- In specific cases with custom navigation logic

### Behavior Features

- With **groupSave: true**, cursor "understands" boundaries between groups
- Improves navigation in masks like phone numbers with area codes
- Works only with rubber (non-fixed) groups
- Doesn't affect data validation or formatting

### Application

Use this property to create more intuitive input interfaces, especially when the mask contains multiple logically separated data groups (country code, area code, number, etc.).
