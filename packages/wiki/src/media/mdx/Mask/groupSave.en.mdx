## Preserving groups on deletion

The `groupSave` property controls behavior when deleting characters in a mask with multiple types of special characters.

**Possible values:**

- `true` — preserves group separation on deletion (default)
- `false` — allows characters from different groups to mix on deletion

With `groupSave: true` and different groups ahead, the character is not physically deleted but marked with a deletion marker, preserving the mask structure. With `false`, characters are deleted completely, which can lead to "collapsing" of groups and loss of structure. Only works for fixed (non-rubber) groups of special characters.

```html
<!-- Preserve group structure (default) -->
<Mask
  mask="***-###"
  :special="['*', '#']"
  groupSave
/>

<!-- Without structure preservation -->
<Mask
  mask="***-###"
  :special="['*', '#']"
  :groupSave="false"
/>
```
