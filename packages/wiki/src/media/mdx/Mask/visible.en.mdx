## Mask visibility control

The `visible` and `visiblePartly` properties are designed for managing the display of mask placeholder characters and overall component visibility.

**Properties:**

- `visible` — controls complete visibility of the mask component
- `visiblePartly` — controls partial visibility of placeholder characters

Properties work together: when `visible: false`, the mask component is completely hidden, including all placeholder characters. When `visiblePartly: true` is activated, only filled mask positions are displayed, hiding empty placeholder characters. If `visible` is set to `false`, the `visiblePartly` property is ignored. Visibility changes don't affect validation logic and data processing, allowing creation of adaptive interfaces with conditional or abbreviated mask display.

```html
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const showMask = ref(true)
const compactMode = ref(false)
</script>

<template>
  <!-- Complete mask hiding -->
  <Mask
    mask="+1 (***) ***-****"
    :visible="false"
  />

  <!-- Show only filled positions -->
  <Mask
    mask="+1 (***) ***-****"
    :visiblePartly="true"
  />

  <!-- Conditional display with partial visibility -->
  <Mask
    mask="+1 (***) ***-****"
    :visible="showMask"
    :visiblePartly="compactMode"
  />
</template>
```
