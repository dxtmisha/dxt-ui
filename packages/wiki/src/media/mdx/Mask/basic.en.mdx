The Mask component provides structured data input with real-time automatic formatting. Allows creating convenient fields for phones, dates, bank cards and other formatted data.

### Key features

- **Automatic formatting**: Adds separators and symbols during typing
- **Flexible templates**: Support for single and multiple masks with automatic selection
- **Error prevention**: Restricts input to only allowed characters
- **Validation integration**: Works together with the data validation system
- **Data type support**: Built-in presets for numbers, currencies and dates

### Usage

Use the component to create input fields with a defined structure: phone numbers, bank cards, dates, postal codes and any other data requiring a specific format.

### Recommendations

Keep templates short and clear for the user. When supporting multiple formats, use an array of masks â€” the component will automatically select the most suitable template as the user types.

- Define a pattern with special characters for input groups
- Literals are auto-inserted during typing
- Multiple patterns can be provided; the best match is selected dynamically
- Works with validation, number/currency formats, and date/time helpers

Tip: keep patterns short and explicit to improve usability.
