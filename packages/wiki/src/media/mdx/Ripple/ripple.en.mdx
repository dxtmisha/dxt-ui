## Ripple Wave Effect on Interaction

The `Ripple` component creates an animated wave effect when clicking on an element, similar to Material Design ripple effect. This enhances user experience by providing visual feedback during interaction.

### How it Works

The component automatically tracks click events and creates an animated wave that expands from the touch point. The effect works by:

- Detecting click coordinates relative to the element
- Creating a temporary element with expansion animation
- Automatically removing the element after animation completion

### Integration

The component should be placed inside an interactive element that needs the ripple effect. The parent element must have `position: relative` for correct effect positioning.

### Properties

- **disabled** â€” Disables the ripple effect when set to `true`

### Recommendations

- Use on buttons, cards, and other interactive elements
- Ensure the parent element has `position: relative`
- Avoid using on elements that frequently change size

### Usage Example

```html
<!-- Button with ripple effect -->
<button style="position: relative;">
  Click me
  <Ripple />
</button>

<!-- Disabled effect -->
<button style="position: relative;">
  No effect
  <Ripple :disabled="true" />
</button>

<!-- Card with effect -->
<div class="card" style="position: relative; cursor: pointer;">
  <h3>Interactive card</h3>
  <p>Card content</p>
  <Ripple />
</div>
```
