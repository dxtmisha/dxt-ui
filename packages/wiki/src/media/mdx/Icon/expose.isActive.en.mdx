### `isActive`

Computed property that determines whether the additional icon is active.

```ts
readonly isActive: ComputedRef<boolean>
```

Returns `true` only when both conditions are met:
- The `active` property is set to `true`
- The `iconActive` property is defined (not empty)

This property is used internally by the component to control the display of primary and additional icons.
