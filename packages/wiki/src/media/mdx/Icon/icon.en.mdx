## Icon State Management

The `icon`, `iconActive`, and `active` properties control the display of the icon based on its state. This allows for the creation of dynamic and interactive elements.

### Properties

- **`icon`** — The main icon displayed by default.
- **`iconActive`** — The icon that is displayed when the component is in an active state (`active` = `true`).
- **`active`** — A boolean property that toggles the component's state between normal and active.

### Description

- The `icon` property is essential for displaying the icon.
- If `iconActive` is not provided, there will be no visual change when the `active` state changes.
- When `active` is set to `true`, the component will attempt to display the icon specified in `iconActive`.
- The `active` property can be used to create toggles, indicators, and other interactive elements.

### Recommendations

- Use `iconActive` to provide visual feedback upon user interaction (e.g., on click or selection).
- Ensure that `icon` and `iconActive` are visually distinct enough for the user to easily identify the state change.

### Usage Example

```html
<!-- Normal icon -->
<Icon icon="home" />

<!-- Active icon -->
<!-- `favorite` will be displayed because active=true -->
<Icon icon="favorite_border" iconActive="favorite" :active="true" />

<!-- Dynamic state toggle -->
<template>
  <Icon
    icon="visibility"
    iconActive="visibility_off"
    :active="isVisible"
    @click="isVisible = !isVisible"
  />
</template>
```
