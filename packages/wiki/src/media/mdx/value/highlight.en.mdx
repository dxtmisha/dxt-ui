## Text Highlighting Properties

The `highlight` and `highlightLengthStart` properties are designed to control text highlighting functionality in components.

### Properties

- **highlight** — Text to highlight within the component content
- **highlightLengthStart** — Minimum length of highlight value to start highlighting

### Property Relationships

The properties work together to provide intelligent text highlighting. `highlight` defines what to highlight, while `highlightLengthStart` controls when to start highlighting.

- `highlight` contains the text string that needs to be found and highlighted in the component
- `highlightLengthStart` sets the minimum search string length to activate the highlighting function
- Highlighting is activated only when the length of `highlight` reaches the `highlightLengthStart` value
- This prevents unwanted highlighting when entering short search strings
- Both properties ensure optimal user experience when working with search and filtering
