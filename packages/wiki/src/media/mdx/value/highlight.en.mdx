## Managing search and highlighting

The `highlight` and `highlightLengthStart` properties work together to control match highlighting when searching through list items. They set the search string and minimum query length for activating visual highlighting of found fragments.

**Properties:**

- `highlight` — search string for finding and highlighting in list items
- `highlightLengthStart` — minimum search string length to start highlighting, defaults to `2`

Match highlighting is activated automatically: when the `highlight` length is less than `highlightLengthStart`, search works but visual highlighting is not applied. When the minimum length is reached, the component begins highlighting found fragments across the entire list hierarchy. Search works in real-time and considers nested items in groups and menus. Use `highlightLengthStart` to prevent excessive highlighting with short queries.

```html
<!-- Standard search with highlighting from 2 characters -->
<List :list="items" highlight="text" />

<!-- Search with highlighting from 3 characters -->
<List :list="items" highlight="abc" :highlightLengthStart="3" />

<!-- Dynamic search with v-model -->
<List :list="items" :highlight="searchQuery" :highlightLengthStart="1" />

<!-- Search without minimum threshold -->
<List :list="products" :highlight="filter" :highlightLengthStart="0" />
```
