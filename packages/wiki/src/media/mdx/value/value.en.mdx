## Value and Data Passing

The `value` and `detail` properties are designed to transfer information when interacting with components and handling events.

**Properties:**

- `value` — main component value (string, number, object)
- `detail` — additional data and contextual information

Properties work together: `value` contains the main component value, which is passed during events and accessible via the expose API. `detail` extends `value` with additional data such as metadata, identifiers, or other auxiliary information. Both properties are available for programmatic reading and passed in component events, providing complete information about the state and context during interaction.
