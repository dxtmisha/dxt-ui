## Value and Data Properties

The `value` and `detail` properties are designed to transfer information when interacting with components.

### Properties

- **value** — Main component value
- **detail** — Additional data and contextual information

### Property Relationship

The properties complement each other, providing complete information about the component's state and context. `value` contains the main value, while `detail` extends it with additional data.

- `value` reflects the current state or value of the component
- `detail` can contain metadata, identifiers, coordinates, or other auxiliary data
- Both properties work together to transfer structured information
