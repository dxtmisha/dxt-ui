## Secondary Badge

The secondary variant offers a balanced approach between primary and outline styles, providing moderate visual emphasis that supports the main content without competing for attention.

### When to use

- **Supporting information**: When displaying important but non-critical data alongside primary content
- **Status updates**: For showing progress, warnings, or informational states that need visibility
- **Content categorization**: To organize and label content with moderate emphasis
- **Hierarchical displays**: When creating visual hierarchy where secondary elements need distinction

### Visual characteristics

- **Moderate contrast**: Balanced color treatment that's noticeable but not overwhelming
- **Softer appearance**: Less intense than primary variants while maintaining clear visibility
- **Versatile styling**: Works well in various contexts and color schemes
- **Content harmony**: Complements primary elements without creating visual competition
