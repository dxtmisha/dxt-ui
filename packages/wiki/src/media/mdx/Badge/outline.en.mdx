## Outline Badge

The outline variant provides a subtle badge style with transparent background and visible border, perfect for secondary information that needs to be noticeable but not dominant.

### When to use

- **Secondary information**: When you need to display supplementary data without overwhelming the main content
- **Status indicators**: For showing neutral or informational states that don't require immediate attention
- **Grouping elements**: To categorize or tag content in a non-intrusive way
- **Light theme compatibility**: When working with light backgrounds where solid badges might be too heavy

### Visual characteristics

- **Transparent background**: Maintains the underlying design while adding informational value
- **Visible border**: Uses border styling to define the badge boundaries
- **Subtle presence**: Less visually prominent than primary or secondary filled variants
- **Flexible appearance**: Adapts well to different background colors and themes
