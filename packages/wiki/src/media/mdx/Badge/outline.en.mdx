## Outline badges (outline)

The Badge component supports outline mode via the `outline` property. In this mode, badges have a minimalist visual style with transparent background and colored border:

- **Minimalist design** - suitable for interfaces requiring reduced visual load
- **Transparent background** - maintains clean appearance when displaying secondary information
- **Subtle presence** - less visually prominent than filled variants
- **Flexible adaptation** - works well with various background colors and themes

Outline mode is especially useful for creating secondary indicators, informational labels, and status markers that should be noticeable but not dominant in the interface's visual hierarchy.

<Badge outline overlap="static">99+</Badge>
<Badge outline overlap="static" icon="info">Info</Badge>
<Badge outline dot overlap="static"/>
```
