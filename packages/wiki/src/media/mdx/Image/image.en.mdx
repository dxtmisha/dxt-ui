Universal component for displaying images, icons, flags, and PDF documents with advanced size, positioning, and adaptability controls.

Image provides a flexible API for working with various types of visual content. The component automatically detects the source type (image, icon, color, file), selects the optimal rendering method (`<img>`, `background-image`, `<picture>`, `<object>`, or icon font), and supports advanced cropping and adaptation features.

**Key Features:**

- Support for multiple source types (URL, File, PDF, Material Icons, flags, colors)
- Flexible rendering with automatic choice between background and img tag
- Adaptive scaling with aspect ratio preservation and srcset support
- Display control via fill modes and coordinate cropping
- Styling support with masks and color filling
- Integration with Material Symbols and system flags

**Typical Use Cases:**

- Responsive images with picture and srcset
- Interface icons (Material Design or SVG masks)
- User avatars with automatic cropping
- Previews of uploaded files and PDF documents
- Background images with complex positioning
- Displaying country flags via CSS sprites

```html
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { Image } from '@dxtmisha/constructor'

const imageUrl = ref('https://example.com/image.jpg')
</script>

<template>
  <!-- Background image with cropping -->
  <Image
    :value="imageUrl"
    size="cover"
    :coordinator="[10, 10, 10, 10]"
  />

  <!-- SEO-friendly image -->
  <Image
    :value="imageUrl"
    tag-img
    alt="Description"
  />

  <!-- Material Design Icon -->
  <Image value="filled-home" />
</template>
```

> The component automatically manages content type and optimizes display based on the source.
