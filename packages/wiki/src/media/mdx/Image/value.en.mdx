## Main value

The `value` property defines the image content. This universal property supports multiple source types for maximum flexibility.

**Supported types:**

- **Icon name** — built-in or custom icon from the design system
- **Image URL** — direct link to file (PNG, JPG, SVG, GIF, WebP, etc.)
- **File object** — JavaScript File object obtained from `<input type="file">`
- **PDF document** — direct link to PDF file with automatic display

The component automatically detects the source type and selects the optimal display method. When passing a File object, the content is read and previewed. The property is reactive and supports dynamic updates.

```html
<!-- Icon by name -->
<Image value="icon-user" />

<!-- Image by URL -->
<Image value="https://example.com/image.png" />

<!-- User file -->
<Image :value="fileFromInput" />
```
