## Property value

The `value` property is responsible for the main content. It is a universal property that supports multiple types of values, making it as flexible as possible for various use cases.

### Supported value types

- **Icon name** — The name of a built-in or custom icon (if supported by the system).
- **String (URL)** — A direct link to an image file (e.g., PNG, JPG, SVG, GIF, WebP, etc.).
- **File object** — A JavaScript `File` object, for example, obtained from `<input type="file">`.
- **PDF link** — A direct link to a PDF file (the PDF document itself will be displayed inside).

### Description

- The `value` property is **optional**. If not set, nothing will be displayed.
- When a `File` object is passed, the component will try to read and display the image or file preview.
- If a PDF link is provided, the PDF document itself will be displayed inside (for example, with page navigation).
- If an icon name is provided, the corresponding icon will be displayed.
- The property is reactive and can be updated dynamically.

### Recommendations

- For the best performance, use optimized image formats (WebP, SVG, etc.).
- Always validate the file type when accepting user uploads.

### Usage example

```html
<!-- Icon by name -->
<Image value="icon-user" />

<!-- Image by URL -->
<Image value="https://example.com/image.png" />

<!-- Image from a File object -->
<input type="file" @change="onFileChange" />
<Image :value="selectedFile" />

<!-- PDF by link -->
<Image value="https://example.com/file.pdf" />
```
