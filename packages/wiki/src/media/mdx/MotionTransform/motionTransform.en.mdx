MotionTransform is a low-level utility that orchestrates element transforms, state transitions, and interaction flows for window-like UI. It centralizes open/show/teleport flags, measures size, updates CSS variables, and coordinates events for smooth, predictable motion.

### Purpose

- **Centralized motion control** — Unified API for managing component visibility and animation states
- **Event coordination** — Handles click interactions, auto-close behavior, and ignore zones
- **Performance optimization** — Efficient DOM manipulation and CSS variable updates
- **Developer experience** — Clean separation between UI logic and motion mechanics

### Core capabilities

- **State management** — Computed accessors for open, show, teleport with simple control API
- **Element handling** — DOM helpers for refs, portals, and class bindings
- **Size coordination** — Measurements and CSS variables to drive smooth transitions
- **Event processing** — Click/auto-close handling with configurable ignore zones
- **Programmatic control** — Imperative methods to open/close and synchronize component flows

### Integration

MotionTransform is designed as a foundational utility for component developers. Use it inside higher-level components when you need consistent behavior, predictable transitions, and clean separation between UI and motion logic.

> This is a low-level utility intended for component library development rather than direct application use.
