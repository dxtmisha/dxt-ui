## Head position animation

The `animationHeadPosition` property controls how the Head area behaves during show/hide animations.

**Possible values:**

- `'top'` — keeps the Head at the top during transition (default)
- `'toBottom'` — animates the Head toward the bottom together with content

Synchronizes header movement with content animation using CSS transforms for smooth transitions. Suitable for collapsing layouts when the header should travel with expanding content. When the `section` property is enabled (set to `true`), the `animationHeadPosition` parameter is ignored and does not affect animation behavior.

```html
<!-- Head stays at top -->
<MotionTransform animationHeadPosition="top" />

<!-- Head moves down with content -->
<MotionTransform animationHeadPosition="toBottom" />
```
