## Head position animation

The `animationHeadPosition` property controls how the Head area behaves during show/hide animations.

```
animationHeadPosition?: 'top' | 'toBottom'
```

### Values

- **`top`** — Keeps the Head at the top during transition (default)
- **`toBottom`** — Animates the Head toward the bottom together with content

### When to use

- **Collapsing layouts** — When the header should travel with expanding/collapsing content
- **Smooth transitions** — For creating more natural motion perception
- **Content hierarchy** — When header position affects content flow understanding

### Features

- **Motion coordination** — Synchronizes header movement with content animation
- **Flexible positioning** — Adapts to different layout requirements
- **Performance optimized** — Uses CSS transforms for smooth animations

### Limitations

- **When `section` is enabled** — If the `section` property is set to `true`, then `animationHeadPosition` is ignored and does not affect animation behavior

> Combine with `animationShow` to fine‑tune the overall motion experience.
