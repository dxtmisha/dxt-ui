### `head`

Slot for rendering the header area that serves as a trigger for opening/closing the component.

This slot lets you:
- Place interactive controls like buttons, titles, or icons
- Receive component state data via scoped slot props
- Control the visual presentation of the trigger area
- Access isOpen, isShow state and CSS classes for styling

The head area typically handles click events to toggle the component's visibility state.
