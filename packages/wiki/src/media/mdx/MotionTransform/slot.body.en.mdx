### `body`

Slot for rendering the main content area that appears when the component is opened.

This slot lets you:
- Place any content like text, forms, lists, or other components
- Receive component state data via scoped slot props
- Access isOpen, isShow state and CSS classes for conditional styling
- Create responsive layouts that adapt to the component's visibility

The body area is typically hidden/shown based on the component's open state and can include animations during transitions.
