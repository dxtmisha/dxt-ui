## Two-way binding (v-model)

The MotionTransform component supports two-way binding for the `open` state using the `v-model:open` directive.

### Usage

This allows you to synchronize the component's visibility with a local data property in your parent component.

```html
<MotionTransform v-model:open="isOpen"/>
```

### How it works

The `v-model:open` is a shorthand for binding the `open` prop and listening to the `update:open` event.

- **`:open="isOpen"`**: The component's visibility is controlled by the `isOpen` ref.
- **`@update:open="isOpen = $event"`**: When the component's internal state changes (e.g., by clicking the head), it emits an event to update the parent's `isOpen` ref.
