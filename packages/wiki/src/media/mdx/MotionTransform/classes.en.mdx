## Helper Classes

The MotionTransform component provides a set of helper CSS classes to manage the states and styling of its elements.

### State Classes

These classes are dynamically added to the component's root element to reflect its current state.

- **`*--open`**: Indicates that the component is fully open and its content is visible.
- **`*--show`**: Added when the component is visible or in the process of an open/close animation. Useful for managing transitions.
- **`*--window`**: Applied when the component is operating in a window-like mode (e.g., with teleportation).
- **`*--click`**: Added briefly on click for creating feedback effects.

### Control Classes

These classes can be added to child elements to control the component's behavior.

- **`*--close`**: Applied to an element that should trigger the closing of MotionTransform on click.
- **`*--none`**: Disables the default behavior (e.g., open/close) for the element it is applied to.
- **`*--noneGlobal`**: Globally disables MotionTransform-related events while this class is present on an element.

### Element Classes

These classes are used for styling the internal parts of the component.

- **`*__context`**: Class for the context element, which can be used for positioning.
- **`*__head`**: Class for the header area, which often acts as a trigger.
- **`*__body`**: Class for the content area that appears and disappears.
- **`*__backdrop`**: Class for the backdrop element, which can be used to create an overlay effect.
- **`*__scrim`**: Class for the scrim layer, often used in modal modes.
- **`*__clickNone`**: Class for an element that should ignore clicks.
