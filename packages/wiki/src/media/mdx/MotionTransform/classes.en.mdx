## CSS Classes for Behavior Control

**State classes:**

- `*--open` — component is fully open and its content is visible
- `*--show` — component is visible or in the process of open/close animation
- `*--window` — component operates in window mode (with teleportation)
- `*--click` — added briefly on click for feedback effects

**Control classes:**

- `*--close` — applied to element to trigger MotionTransform closing on click
- `*--none` — disables default behavior (open/close) for the element
- `*--noneGlobal` — globally disables MotionTransform events

**Element classes:**

- `*__context` — class for context element for positioning
- `*__head` — class for header area that acts as a trigger
- `*__body` — class for content area that appears and disappears
- `*__backdrop` — class for backdrop element to create overlay effect
- `*__scrim` — class for scrim layer in modal modes
- `*__clickNone` — class for element that ignores clicks

Where `*` is the component class name (e.g., `d1-motion-transform`, `m3-motion-transform`).
