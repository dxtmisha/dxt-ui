## Ignore zones

Properties that exclude elements from outside-click checks and auto-close logic: `ignore` accepts a DOM element or selector, while `ignoreSelector` accepts any CSS selector for multiple/dynamic matches.

```
ignore?: HTMLElement | string
ignoreSelector?: string
```

### Properties

- **`ignore`** — Element reference or CSS selector to exclude from outside-click detection
- **`ignoreSelector`** — CSS selector that can match multiple elements for exclusion

### When to use

- **Trigger buttons** — Prevent the trigger from closing the component when clicked
- **Helper controls** — Keep auxiliary UI elements from interfering with auto-close
- **Nested interactive areas** — Maintain functionality of embedded components
- **Dynamic content** — Handle elements that appear/disappear during interaction

### Comparison

- **`ignore`** — More precise, can reference a specific DOM element directly
- **`ignoreSelector`** — More flexible, can match multiple elements with a single selector
- **Performance** — `ignore` is faster for single elements, `ignoreSelector` is better for collections

### Features

- **Event coordination** — Both properties work together during outside-click evaluation
- **Selector flexibility** — Support for any valid CSS selector patterns
- **Dynamic updates** — Changes are reflected immediately in click detection

> Keep selectors specific to avoid unintended matches that could prevent auto-close functionality.
