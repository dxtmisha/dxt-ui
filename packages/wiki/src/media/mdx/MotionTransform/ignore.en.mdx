## Ignore zones

Properties that exclude elements from outside-click checks and auto-close logic.

**Properties:**

- `ignore` — DOM element reference or CSS selector to exclude from outside-click detection
- `ignoreSelector` — CSS selector to exclude multiple elements simultaneously

Both properties work together during outside-click evaluation. `ignore` is more precise and faster for single elements, can reference a specific DOM element directly. `ignoreSelector` is more flexible, can match multiple elements with a single selector, better suited for dynamic content. Use for trigger buttons, helper controls, and nested interactive areas.

```html
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const triggerButton = ref()
</script>

<template>
  <!-- Ignoring specific element -->
  <MotionTransform :ignore="triggerButton" />

  <!-- Ignoring by selector -->
  <MotionTransform ignoreSelector=".trigger-button" />

  <!-- Combining both properties -->
  <MotionTransform
    :ignore="triggerButton"
    ignoreSelector=".helper-controls"
  />
</template>
```
