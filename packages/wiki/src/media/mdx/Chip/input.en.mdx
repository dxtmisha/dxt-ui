## Input chips (input)

The Chip component supports input mode through the `input` property. In this mode, chips have an input field style and represent discrete information entered by the user:

- **Form-like appearance** - visually resemble input elements
- **User data** - display tags, contacts, keywords
- **Interactivity** - can be removed or edited
- **Grouping** - often used in sets for multiple selections

Input mode is especially useful for displaying data that users have actively entered or selected, making them visually distinct from static interface elements.
