## Assistive chips (assistive)

The Chip component supports assistive mode through the `assistive` property. In this mode, chips have a special visual style to help users complete tasks:

- **Distinctive style** - visually stand out among other elements
- **Hints and recommendations** - suggest action options or auto-completion
- **User guidance** - help navigate the interface
- **Icon support** - improve understanding of purpose through visual elements

Assistive mode is especially useful for creating hint systems, recommendations, and helper actions that guide users to the right solutions without excessive visual noise.
