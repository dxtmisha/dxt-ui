### `helper`

Slot for rendering a helper (hint) message below an input field. It lets you fully override the text, markup, and styling of the hint, and optionally inject additional content.

This slot allows you to:
- Render custom markup instead of the default helper text
- Add icons/links/formatting inside the message
- Control visibility and states via scoped props
- Localize and swap the text depending on context

Typically, the `helper` area is placed under the input and inherits base spacing/typography from the design system. If a validation message is present at the same time, it has priority over the helper.
