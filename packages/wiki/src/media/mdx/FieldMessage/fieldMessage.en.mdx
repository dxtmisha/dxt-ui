FieldMessage is a component for displaying helper and validation messages below form fields.

### Purpose

- Helper message — a hint or guidance for the user under the field
- Validation message — an error text shown on invalid input
- Forced display — controlled via the forceShow property
- Smart visibility — automatic logic based on provided values

### Key features

- Message priority — validation message has priority over helper text
- Flexible sources — supports both static and reactive values
- Compatibility — works with input fields and character counter
- Configurable rendering — via the design system and component attributes

### Integration

Use FieldMessage alongside input fields to show hints and errors, and together with FieldCounter for more informative forms.

> The component focuses on text messages and should be used with input controls.
