## Circular Progress and Related Parameters

The `circular` property enables circular progress indicator display mode. For optimal control over the appearance and behavior of circular progress, it is recommended to use it together with additional styling properties.

### Properties

- **circular** — Enables circular progress display mode as a ring indicator.
- **dense** — Removes internal padding, allowing the indicator to be used in small elements where space is limited.

### Description

- The `circular` property activates a ring progress indicator that fills around the circumference proportionally to the current value.
- `dense` removes padding, making the indicator more compact for placement in limited space.
- Both properties work together to create a flexible and adaptive circular progress indicator.

### Recommendations

- Use `circular` to display progress in compact interfaces or when a central focus is needed.
- Apply `dense` in small elements where space-saving is important and padding needs to be removed.
- Combine properties depending on available space and design requirements.
- Circular progress is particularly effective for displaying process completion.

### Usage Example

```html
<!-- Basic circular progress -->
<Progress circular />

<!-- Compact circular progress -->
<Progress circular dense />

<!-- Circular progress with specific value -->
<Progress circular :value="75" />

<!-- Compact circular progress with value -->
<Progress circular dense :value="50" />
```
