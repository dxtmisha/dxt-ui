## Progress Indicator

The `Progress` component is designed to display the progress of operations, data loading, or any other processes that require visual representation of completion status.

### Key Features

The component supports various types of progress-display - linear and circular indicators, as well as point variants for minimal display. It can work with both determinate progress values and indeterminate states for operations with unknown execution time.

Provides flexible positioning and styling options, including compact and inverted display variants. Supports delay settings for smooth appearance and hiding of the indicator.
