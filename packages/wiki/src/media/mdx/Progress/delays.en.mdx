## Progress Delay Management

The `delay` and `delayHide` properties control timing parameters for showing and hiding the progress indicator. These properties allow creating a smoother user experience by avoiding flickers during fast operations.

### Properties

- **delay** — Delay before showing the progress indicator in milliseconds. Defaults to 360 ms.
- **delayHide** — Delay before hiding the progress indicator in milliseconds. Defaults to 200 ms.

### Recommendations

- Use the standard `delay="360"` value for most cases - it's been proven in practice.
- Increase `delay` for rapid operations where the indicator might interfere with perception.
- Decrease `delay` for long operations where users need immediate feedback.
- Adjust `delayHide` based on context—for critical operations you can increase the value.

### Usage Example

```html
<!-- Standard delays -->
<Progress delay="360" delayHide="200" />

<!-- Fast appearance for long operations -->
<Progress delay="100" delayHide="200" />

<!-- Slow appearance for fast operations -->
<Progress delay="800" delayHide="300" />

<!-- No delays -->
<Progress delay="0" delayHide="0" />
```
