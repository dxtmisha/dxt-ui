## Progress Delay Management

The `delay` and `delayHide` properties control timing parameters for showing and hiding the progress indicator. These properties allow creating a smoother user experience by avoiding flickers during fast operations.

**Properties:**

- `delay` — delay before showing the indicator in milliseconds, defaults to `360`
- `delayHide` — delay before hiding the indicator in milliseconds, defaults to `200`

The standard `delay="360"` value is proven in practice and suitable for most cases. Increase `delay` for rapid operations where the indicator might interfere with perception. Decrease for long operations where immediate feedback is important.

```html
<!-- Standard delays -->
<Progress delay="360" delayHide="200" />

<!-- Fast appearance -->
<Progress delay="100" delayHide="200" />

<!-- Slow appearance -->
<Progress delay="800" delayHide="300" />

<!-- No delays -->
<Progress delay="0" delayHide="0" />
```
