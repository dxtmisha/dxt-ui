## Static Mode (staticMode)

The Window component supports static mode operation through the `staticMode` property. In this mode, the window works as an embedded component without modal behavior:

- **Content displays immediately** - window is not hidden and doesn't require activation
- **Animations disabled** - no appearance/disappearance effects
- **Positioning disabled** - window is embedded in document flow
- **Works with adaptive** - when `adaptive` property has one of static mode values (for example, `static`), static mode is enabled

Static mode is especially useful for embedding window content directly into the interface without modal behavior.
