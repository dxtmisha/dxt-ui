## Positioning axis (axis)

The `axis` property controls the primary positioning axis of the window relative to the anchor element (`overElement`) or the invocation area.
Default value: `y`.

> Works only in menu mode (`adaptive="menu"`).

### Values

- `x` — Horizontal axis: the window is placed to the left or right of the anchor/cursor. The `indent` is applied horizontally.
- `y` — Vertical axis: the window is placed above or below the anchor/cursor. The `indent` is applied vertically.
- `on` — “Over element” mode: the window is positioned over the selected element/area vertically, using its center as a reference. If needed, the window’s internal scroll adjusts to keep the selected element visible.

### Common behavior

- Automatic side selection (left/right for `x`, top/bottom for `y`) based on available space. If both sides lack space, the window is centered within the available area.
- Along the orthogonal axis, the window is fitted into the viewport to avoid overflow.
- Context menu mode (`contextmenu = true`) uses cursor coordinates instead of the anchor’s bounding box.
- Viewport constraints and container paddings are respected.

### Recommendations

- `x` — side menus, tooltips, and panels next to an element.
- `y` — dropdowns, menus, and hints opening above/below.
- `on` — popovers that overlay and focus a specific element in the content.
