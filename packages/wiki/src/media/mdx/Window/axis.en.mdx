## Positioning direction

The `axis` property defines the primary guide for placing the window relative to the anchor element (`overElement`) or the invocation area.
Default value: `y`.

> Works only in menu mode (`adaptive="menu"`).

### Values

- `x` — Horizontal: places the window to the left or right of the anchor/cursor. The `indent` is applied horizontally.
- `y` — Vertical: places the window above or below the anchor/cursor. The `indent` is applied vertically.
- `on` — Over element: overlays the selected element/area and aligns to its center. When needed, internal scrolling adapts to keep the selected element visible.

### Behavior

- Automatic side selection (left/right for `x`, top/bottom for `y`) based on available space. If space is limited on both sides, the window is centered in the available area.
- Along the perpendicular direction the window fits into the viewport to avoid overflow.
- Context menu mode (`contextmenu = true`) uses cursor coordinates instead of the anchor’s bounding box.
- Respects viewport constraints and container paddings.

### Recommendations

- `x` — side menus, tooltips, and panels next to an element.
- `y` — dropdowns, menus, and hints opening above/below.
- `on` — popovers that overlay and focus a specific element in the content.
