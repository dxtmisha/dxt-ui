## CSS Classes for Behavior Control

- `*--block` — prevents window from closing when clicking outside its boundaries
- `*--blockChildren` — prevents current window from closing
- `*--blockOther` — prevents other windows from closing until current one is closed
- `*--close` — applies to elements for closing the window
- `*--controlOpenOnly` — applies to control elements that only open the window
- `*--controlStatic` — applies to control elements in static mode
- `*--static` — applies to elements inside window, canceling all actions

Where `*` is the component class name (e.g., `d1-window`, `m3-window`).
