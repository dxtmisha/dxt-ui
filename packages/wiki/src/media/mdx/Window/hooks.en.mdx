## Lifecycle Hooks

The Window component provides a lifecycle hooks system for managing various stages of the window lifecycle.

### Opening Hooks

**`preparation`** - Called during the window preparation phase before opening.
Allows executing preliminary setup and data initialization.

**`beforeOpening`** - Called immediately before the window opening process begins.
Returning `false` prevents the window from opening.

**`opening`** - Called during the window opening process while animation is running.
Returning `false` interrupts the window opening process.

### Closing Hooks

**`beforeClosing`** - Called immediately before the window closing process begins.
Returning `false` prevents the window from closing.

**`closing`** - Called during the window closing process while animation is running.
Returning `false` interrupts the window closing process.

### Usage

All hooks are asynchronous functions and can return `Promise<boolean>` or `boolean`. Returning `false` stops the execution of the corresponding action.

```typescript
{
  preparation: async () => {
    // Data preparation
    await loadData()
  },
  beforeOpening: () => {
    // Condition checking
    return userCanOpenWindow()
  },
  opening: () => {
    // Logic during opening
    return true
  },
  beforeClosing: () => {
    // Check before closing
    return confirmClose()
  },
  closing: () => {
    // Cleanup on closing
    cleanup()
    return true
  }
}
```
