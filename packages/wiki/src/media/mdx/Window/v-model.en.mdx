## Two-way binding (v-model)

The Window component supports two-way binding of the open state via the `v-model` directive.

### Props and events

- `open: boolean` — window visibility state
- `update:open(boolean)` — update event emitted when the state changes

```html
<Window v-model:open="isOpen"/>
```

### Notes
- Programmatic control remains available via expose methods (`open`/`toggle`/`setOpen`) and corresponding events.
- If you need a static, always-mounted window (that ignores v-model), see the `staticMode` section.
