# dxt-ui

A modular Vue 3 UI library and design system constructor featuring AI-automated documentation, TypeScript support, and a flexible component architecture.

## Key Features

*   **Vue 3 & Composition API**: Built using modern Vue 3 patterns, including `<script setup>` and Composition API for optimal performance and developer experience.
*   **TypeScript First**: Written entirely in TypeScript with comprehensive type definitions for Props, Emits, Slots, and Expose interfaces.
*   **Constructor Architecture**: Unique separation of concerns where component logic is encapsulated in "Design" classes (e.g., `AccordionDesign`), decoupling behavior from the visual representation.
*   **AI-Driven Documentation**: Integrated tooling to automatically generate detailed MDX documentation for Storybook by analyzing component code and types.
*   **Modular Ecosystem**:
    *   `@dxtmisha/constructor`: Core logic and state management.
    *   `@dxtmisha/styles`: SCSS mixins and CSS variable tokens.
    *   `@dxtmisha/functional`: Utility functions and helpers.
*   **Advanced Component Capabilities**:
    *   Keyboard navigation and accessibility support.
    *   Built-in AJAX data loading and caching.
    *   Virtualization support for handling large datasets.
*   **Storybook Integration**: First-class development environment with auto-generated controls and interactive documentation.
